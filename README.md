A Tactical Viewpoint
Real Madrid might play 4-2-4 andâ€‚begin by getting in Arsenalâ€™s faces on the flanks. MbappÃ© and VinÃ­ciusâ€‚will seek out the occasional counterattack, while Valverde and Modric will try to dominate in the middle of the field. Combat willâ€‚be tense and literal.
But Arsenal spends a great deal of its time absorbing pressure, and sitting just out of possession, and both Saka and Martinelli have a tendency to do their best workâ€‚in the break. Set pieces remain an important weapon, riceâ€‚and parley knocked up in front.

Match odds:Real Madrid 7/10, Arsenal 7/2, Drawâ€‚3/1
This isnâ€™t lost untilâ€‚the final whistle blows for we know the kind of late-match magic Real Madrid can command at the BernabÃ©u. Which team is supposedâ€‚to win, according to theory? Arsenal.
When the rematch arrives at the BernabÃ©u, Arsenal will at least be at home because they return to Gunners HQ with a three-nil aggregate to theâ€‚good. Without the bulk of Real Madrid's players, it will be an uphillâ€‚battle for the team to get to the final four. All this means that Arsenal,â€‚unbeaten and unbroken in Europe, can now set their sights on the less humble, much more exotic Champions League final

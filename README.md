A Tactical Viewpoint
Real Madrid might play 4-2-4 and begin by getting in Arsenal’s faces on the flanks. Mbappé and Vinícius will seek out the occasional counterattack, while Valverde and Modric will try to dominate in the middle of the field. Combat will be tense and literal.
But Arsenal spends a great deal of its time absorbing pressure, and sitting just out of possession, and both Saka and Martinelli have a tendency to do their best work in the break. Set pieces remain an important weapon, rice and parley knocked up in front.

Match odds:Real Madrid 7/10, Arsenal 7/2, Draw 3/1
This isn’t lost until the final whistle blows for we know the kind of late-match magic Real Madrid can command at the Bernabéu. Which team is supposed to win, according to theory? Arsenal.
When the rematch arrives at the Bernabéu, Arsenal will at least be at home because they return to Gunners HQ with a three-nil aggregate to the good. Without the bulk of Real Madrid's players, it will be an uphill battle for the team to get to the final four. All this means that Arsenal, unbeaten and unbroken in Europe, can now set their sights on the less humble, much more exotic Champions League final
